# TrainAIModel

TrainAIModel is a simple machine learning model designed to answer questions based on a dataset of question-answer pairs. If the model does not recognize a question, it prompts for an answer, retrains itself, and stores the new information for future use.

## Getting Started

To set up and use this project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

Install the dependencies:
```bash
Project Structure

src/dataset.py: Add or modify your question-answer dataset here.
trainModel.py: This script trains the model on the dataset provided.
qa_model.pkl: The trained model file, generated after training.
app.py: The main application script to run the question-answer interface.
Setup and Usage
Prepare the Dataset
Go to the src folder and open dataset.py. Modify or add your question-answer pairs as needed.

Train the Model
Once your dataset is ready, run the following command to train the model:

bash
python trainModel.py
This will create a qa_model.pkl file, which contains the trained model.

Run the Application
After training is complete, start the application by running:

bash
python app.py
You will be prompted with an input field where you can ask questions.

Ask Questions

If your question matches one in the dataset, the model will provide an answer.
If the question is not recognized, the model will prompt you to provide an answer. It will then retrain itself to remember the new answer for future queries.
Example
Train the model:

bash
python trainModel.py
Run the app and ask a question:

bash
python app.py
If the question is unknown, provide an answer when prompted. The model will learn this new question-answer pair and store it for future use.

Future Improvements
This project is set up for basic question-answer functionality and can be expanded to:

Enhance model accuracy with advanced NLP techniques.
Integrate a web interface for ease of access.
